## Codex execution

Resolve `SEO_ROOT` from this skill's installed path (three directories above its
folder); `SKILL_ROOT` is this folder. Replace angle-bracket path placeholders
with those absolute paths. They are documentation placeholders, not shell variables.
Use the available Python 3.11+ executable (`python3` on POSIX, `py -3` or
`python` on Windows; use PowerShell's `&` for a quoted executable path).
Run bundled tools with [the native runner](../../../scripts/codex-seo.py).
Use actual host tools for file reads, edits, web access and optional delegation;
Claude tool/model names in reference material are not executable tool IDs.
Keep the user's selected Codex model; Claude model allocations are historical.
Use numeric scores only with a disclosed rubric and evidence coverage; otherwise
give an evidence/status card. Reference word floors, keyword density and English
readability targets are heuristics, not requirements for every language or tool.
Run specialist procedures inline when delegation is unavailable or not authorized.
Follow [the Codex operating rules](../../OPERATING-RULES.md) and keep each project's
scope, market, evidence, private credentials and output directory separate.
Provider setup: `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" integration PROVIDER`
shows Codex instructions; it never runs the legacy Claude installers.


## Extension Seranking workflow


# seo-seranking

Live AI visibility tracking via the SE Ranking REST API.

## Prerequisites

- Run `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" integration seranking` (or `install.ps1`).
- An SE Ranking API key (https://seranking.com/api.html).
- Before any call, verify `SERANKING_API_KEY` is present in `~/.claude/settings.json` under `env.`. If absent, tell the user to run the installer.

## Routing

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `$seo seranking ai-visibility <brand>` | Share-of-voice for `brand` across ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, AI Overviews, AI Mode |
| `$seo seranking serp <keyword>` | Top 100 organic positions + SERP features |
| `$seo seranking backlinks <url>` | Backlink profile (alternative vendor source to Ahrefs / DataForSEO) |
| `$seo seranking competitors <url>` | Top 10 organic competitors and shared-keyword gaps |

## AI Share-of-Voice scoring

SE Ranking samples each AI platform's responses for brand mentions
across a configurable prompt set. The scorer is the same logic used
by Profound / Peec AI but bundled into one MCP/API. Output fields:

- `chatgpt_sov`: % of sampled prompts where the brand appears in the response.
- `gemini_sov`: same, against Google Gemini.
- `perplexity_sov`: same, against Perplexity.
- `ai_overviews_sov`: brand citation rate inside Google AI Overviews.
- `ai_mode_sov`: brand citation rate inside Google AI Mode (US English first).

Report each as a percentage with a confidence note based on sample size.

## Cost guardrails

SE Ranking API uses unit accounting. Single AI visibility query is
~5 units (1 per platform). Use `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" run dataforseo_costs.py` to log
spend across vendors.

## Cross-skill delegation

- For traditional backlinks + content audit, fall back to `seo-backlinks` / `seo-content`.
- For platform-specific deep-dives (ChatGPT only, Perplexity only), prefer the dedicated `seo-geo` skill which has Brand Mention Correlation guidance.
