## Codex execution

Resolve `SEO_ROOT` from this skill's installed path (three directories above its
folder); `SKILL_ROOT` is this folder. Replace angle-bracket path placeholders
with those absolute paths. They are documentation placeholders, not shell variables.
Use the available Python 3.11+ executable (`python3` on POSIX, `py -3` or
`python` on Windows; use PowerShell's `&` for a quoted executable path).
Run bundled tools with [the native runner](../../../scripts/codex-seo.py).
Use actual host tools for file reads, edits, web access and optional delegation;
Claude tool/model names in reference material are not executable tool IDs.
Keep the user's selected Codex model; Claude model allocations are historical.
Use numeric scores only with a disclosed rubric and evidence coverage; otherwise
give an evidence/status card. Reference word floors, keyword density and English
readability targets are heuristics, not requirements for every language or tool.
Run specialist procedures inline when delegation is unavailable or not authorized.
Follow [the Codex operating rules](../../OPERATING-RULES.md) and keep each project's
scope, market, evidence, private credentials and output directory separate.
Provider setup: `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" integration PROVIDER`
shows Codex instructions; it never runs the legacy Claude installers.

Run `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" run dataforseo_costs.py summary`. Label missing or incomplete ledger data; no spending is implied by viewing the ledger. Estimates are not invoices or permission for paid calls.
