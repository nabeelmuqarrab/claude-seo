## Codex execution

Resolve `SEO_ROOT` from this skill's installed path (three directories above its
folder); `SKILL_ROOT` is this folder. Replace angle-bracket path placeholders
with those absolute paths. They are documentation placeholders, not shell variables.
Use the available Python 3.11+ executable (`python3` on POSIX, `py -3` or
`python` on Windows; use PowerShell's `&` for a quoted executable path).
Run bundled tools with [the native runner](../../../scripts/codex-seo.py).
Use actual host tools for file reads, edits, web access and optional delegation;
Claude tool/model names in reference material are not executable tool IDs.
Keep the user's selected Codex model; Claude model allocations are historical.
Use numeric scores only with a disclosed rubric and evidence coverage; otherwise
give an evidence/status card. Reference word floors, keyword density and English
readability targets are heuristics, not requirements for every language or tool.
Run specialist procedures inline when delegation is unavailable or not authorized.
Follow [the Codex operating rules](../../OPERATING-RULES.md) and keep each project's
scope, market, evidence, private credentials and output directory separate.
Provider setup: `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" integration PROVIDER`
shows Codex instructions; it never runs the legacy Claude installers.


## Extension Unlighthouse workflow


# seo-unlighthouse

Run Lighthouse against every URL on a site (up to a configurable cap)
and aggregate the results. Useful when:

- PageSpeed Insights' free quota (25k QPD) isn't enough for a large site.
- You want offline / local CWV measurement (CI integration, restricted environments).
- You need a quick site-wide regression check after a deploy.

## Prerequisites

- Run `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" integration unlighthouse` (no API key needed).
- Node 18+ on `$PATH`.

## Routing

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `$seo unlighthouse <url>` | Mobile audit, up to 200 routes, JSON+HTML report in a temp dir |
| `$seo unlighthouse <url> --device desktop` | Desktop form factor |
| `$seo unlighthouse <url> --max-routes 50 --output-dir ./reports` | Cap + persist |

All flags forward through `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" run unlighthouse_run.py`, which handles
url_safety pre-flight and subprocess timeout management.

## Output handling

The wrapper reads `ci-result.json` from the Unlighthouse output dir, normalizes
it (the default `jsonSimple` reporter writes a flat JSON array of per-route
results; a tolerant fallback also accepts the `jsonExpanded` object shape),
and returns:

- `route_count`: number of routes actually audited
- `aggregate_scores`: median score per Lighthouse category across all audited
  routes (`performance`, `accessibility`, `best-practices`, `seo`)
- `routes`: the per-route breakdown (also on disk at `<output_dir>/ci-result.json`)

Route cap and per-page timeout are set via a generated `unlighthouse.config.mjs`
passed with `--config-file` (the only CLI-documented way to set `scanner.maxRoutes`;
unlighthouse-ci has no `--max-routes` flag). Use `--page-timeout <seconds>` to
change the per-page Lighthouse task timeout (default 60s); this is separate
from the overall `--timeout` subprocess guard (default 600s).

## Cross-skill delegation

- For single-URL field data (CrUX), use `seo-google psi` / `seo-google crux`.
- For LCP subpart decomposition on slow pages, use the
  `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" run lcp_subparts.py` workflow (Phase C).
