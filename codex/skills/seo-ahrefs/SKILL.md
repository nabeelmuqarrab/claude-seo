## Codex execution

Resolve `SEO_ROOT` from this skill's installed path (three directories above its
folder); `SKILL_ROOT` is this folder. Replace angle-bracket path placeholders
with those absolute paths. They are documentation placeholders, not shell variables.
Use the available Python 3.11+ executable (`python3` on POSIX, `py -3` or
`python` on Windows; use PowerShell's `&` for a quoted executable path).
Run bundled tools with [the native runner](../../../scripts/codex-seo.py).
Use actual host tools for file reads, edits, web access and optional delegation;
Claude tool/model names in reference material are not executable tool IDs.
Keep the user's selected Codex model; Claude model allocations are historical.
Use numeric scores only with a disclosed rubric and evidence coverage; otherwise
give an evidence/status card. Reference word floors, keyword density and English
readability targets are heuristics, not requirements for every language or tool.
Run specialist procedures inline when delegation is unavailable or not authorized.
Follow [the Codex operating rules](../../OPERATING-RULES.md) and keep each project's
scope, market, evidence, private credentials and output directory separate.
Provider setup: `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" integration PROVIDER`
shows Codex instructions; it never runs the legacy Claude installers.


## Extension Ahrefs workflow


# seo-ahrefs

Live Ahrefs data via the tested `@ahrefs/mcp@0.0.11` server.
Package check (2026-07-10): verify the current Ahrefs MCP package source before changing this tested version.

## Prerequisites

- Run `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" integration ahrefs` (Linux/macOS) or `install.ps1` (Windows) before using this skill.
- An Ahrefs API token (https://ahrefs.com/api).
- Node 18+ on `$PATH` for the MCP server.

Before calling any Ahrefs tool, verify the MCP is connected by checking
that any Ahrefs MCP tool is available in this session. If tools are
not available, tell the user the extension is not installed and
provide the install command above.

## Routing

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `$seo ahrefs metrics <url>` | Domain / URL rating, referring domain count, organic traffic estimate |
| `$seo ahrefs backlinks <url>` | Top referring domains, anchor distribution, follow/nofollow ratio |
| `$seo ahrefs organic <url>` | Organic keywords, ranking distribution, traffic by country |
| `$seo ahrefs content <topic>` | Content Explorer top results, social shares, referring domains |

## Output conventions

- Cite the data source on every metric: "Ahrefs (live, confidence 1.00)".
- When Ahrefs and Moz disagree on the same metric, trust Ahrefs and note the discrepancy in the report.
- Toxic link assessment: combine Ahrefs backlink quality signals with the existing seo-backlinks Common Crawl + verify crawler signals.

## Cross-skill delegation

- For multi-source confidence weighting across Moz + Bing + Common Crawl + Ahrefs, hand back to `seo-backlinks`.
- For SERP-feature analysis where Ahrefs and DataForSEO overlap, prefer DataForSEO for live SERP data.

## Cost guardrails

Ahrefs API usage is metered per unit. Before running a batch (>= 50 URLs):

1. Estimate cost with `python "<SEO_ROOT>/scripts/codex-seo.py" run dataforseo_costs.py` (the cost-tracker module is generic and supports Ahrefs unit accounting).
2. Surface the estimate to the orchestrator.
3. Log actual cost after each call.

This is the same workflow the seo-dataforseo skill uses.
